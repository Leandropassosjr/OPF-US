# OPFython: A python-inspired Optimum-Path Forest classifier

## Welcome to OPFython.
Have you ever wanted to classify data into labels? If yes, OPFython is for you! This package is an innovative way of dealing with an optimum-path forest classifier. From bottom to top, from samples and datasets to the actual classifier, we will foster all research related to this newly trend.

Use OPFython if you need a library or wish to:
* Create your own datasets.
* Design or use pre-loaded state-of-art classifiers.
* Mix-and-match different strategies to solve your problem.
* Because it is cool to classify things.

Read the docs at [opfython.recogna.tech](http://opfython.recogna.tech).

OPFython is compatible with: **Python 2.7-3.6**.

## Getting started: 60 seconds with OPFython

First of all. We have examples. Yes, they are commented. Just browse to `examples/`, chose your subpackage and follow the example. We have high-level examples for most tasks we could think of.

Or if you wish to learn even more, please take a minute:

NALP is based on the following structure, and you should pay attention to its tree:

```
- opfython
    - core
        - dataset
        - sample
    - math
    - utils
```

### Core

Core is the core. Essentially, it is the parent of everything. You should find parent classes defining the basic of our structure. They should provide variables and methods that will help to construct other modules. It is composed by the following classes:

1. Dataset

2. Sample

### Math

### Utils
